<Card class="card-image" img="awesome_sealing.jpeg">
	If you let pavers go too long without being sealed, you could face a very expensive repair or
	replacement down the road. Paver Sealing is the process of cleaning, sanding, and sealing pavers.
	<br class="break-space" />
	The sealant lasts three years and protects your pavers from weathering, UV exposure, growth in the
	joints, and discoloration. It also repels water, oil and anything else that might get spilled.
